The WeatherApp is a JavaFX application that provides users with current weather information based on the city and state they input. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, current weather conditions, and a brief description. To use the app, users simply enter the desired city and state into the text fields and click the "Fetch Weather" button. The application then retrieves the weather data and displays it on the screen. The app asks the user what city and state that they want the weather from, they enter that and then it will print out the weather in that area, by taking data that is stored in a storage in the code.
